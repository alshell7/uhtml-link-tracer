<blockquote>
<p>What is a uhtml ?
Well its a file thats made officially by <code>UC browser</code> apps of J2MEE or Android platforms, and is created when one 
saves the page (web page) inside the browser.</p>

</h2>

<p>The web page files saved by the browser are not accessible outside the app or anywhere, kind of encrypted or some 
what. I usually save them, and have a look at them later. Pretty much like a bookmark (but use them even if I am 
not over internet). I had a necessity, to get the links out of them and save them as my bookmark in my PC not 
restricting to use via UC browser itself. This is app is my poor attempt to keep those pages accessible outside 
my phone. Couldn't find any tool for it, and having millions of people using the browser, so I made this simple 
utility app for desktops to convert your uhtml web page files to links saved from the UC browser. Hoping that 
some one facing the same problem to trace back url's of those pages, <code>.uhtml Link Tracer</code> should be a time savior <g-emoji alias="innocent" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png">ðŸ˜‡</g-emoji></p>
