  "body": "#.uhtml Link Tracer\r\n> What is a uhtml ?\r\nWell its a file thats made officially by `UC browser` apps of J2MEE or Android platforms, and is created when one \r\nsaves the page (web page) inside the browser.\r\n\r\n##*Description*\r\nThe web page files saved by the browser are not accessible outside the app or anywhere, kind of encrypted or some \r\nwhat. I usually save them, and have a look at them later. Pretty much like a bookmark (but use them even if I am \r\nnot over internet). I had a necessity, to get the links out of them and save them as my bookmark in my PC not \r\nrestricting to use via UC browser itself. This is app is my poor attempt to keep those pages accessible outside \r\nmy phone. Couldn't find any tool for it, and having millions of people using the browser, so I made this simple \r\nutility app for desktops to convert your uhtml web page files to links saved from the UC browser. Hoping that \r\nsome one facing the same problem to trace back url's of those pages, `.uhtml Link Tracer` should be a time savior :innocent:\r\n\r\n![Image of uhtml app](https://github.com/alshell7/uhtml-link-tracer/blob/master/assets/graphics/2_browsed.PNG)\r\n\r\n##*Requirements*\r\n* Windows Platform (Greater than Windows 7) with minimum `.NET framework v3.5` installed should be enough.\r\n\r\n##*How to use*\r\n* Connect your phone (or not if you've already have them in your PC)\r\n* Locate the files (*.uhtml) under \"UCDownloads/Pages\" (Android) / Your default save location (if J2MEE/s40 platform browser)\r\n* Hit `Extract the Links!` button, Presto !\r\n\r\n##*Features*\r\n* Clean UI to work out the stuff.\r\n* `Save all` the links in a text file in a bundle.\r\n* `Preview` the links with inline browser or in your default PC browser\r\n\r\n![Image2 of uhtml app](https://github.com/alshell7/uhtml-link-tracer/blob/master/assets/graphics/1_preview_link.PNG)\r\n\r\n##*To do*\r\n- [ ] Convert the uhtml to html directly.\r\n- [ ] Have same app for any of mobile platforms.\r\n\r\n##*License Agreement*\r\n\r\nREAD CAREFULLY ALL TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE USING\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE\r\nAGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS SOFTWARE\r\nPermission is hereby granted to anyone to freely use `uhtml Link Tracer`\r\nfor any purpose with the exception of including it in a\r\nproduct, in which case both permission and acknowledgment are\r\nrequired.\r\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the software\r\nand documentation are provided \"as is\". alshell\r\n(hereafter referred to as 'the author') disclaim all other\r\nwarranties and conditions, either express or implied, including,\r\nbut not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness\r\nfor a particular purpose, conformance with description, title and\r\nnon-infringement of third party rights.
